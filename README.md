Next thing to do:
1. change the routes to RESTful
2. beautify the front end

Instructions:
 
- Build a basic flask web app that serves the purpose of a to-do list.
- You should be able to add tasks, that would be displayed on the page
- Remove or complete them with a checkbox that would remove them from the page
- Each task should have two fields, a title and a deadline

Optional to stand out:
- Make the tasks ordered by deadline
- Add the option to edit a task title or deadline
- Other small functionalities that you believe could help (resetting everything or others)
